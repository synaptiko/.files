# Simplification

- I don't think I need gnupg anymore, try to remove all the configs and stuff for it and check what will break: ie. password protected keys, VSCode's keychain etc.
- clean-up  the list below :-D

---

- check and update adwaita themes, there is some weird conflict and it's compiling qt4 which I don't need
- check why install-dependencies didn't work properly (it looks like it installs only aur deps)

- consider usage of `dash-static-musl` instead of bash for some of my scripts
- add later `wl-clipboard` and `wl-clipboard-x11` (but I have some problems with it currently)
- add "generic" desktop folder which will contain desktop deps/initialization
- add support for dmesg -D before getty is started (use disable-dmesg-getty.service as inspiration)
- consider adding users' configuration (multiuser support)
	- prepare synaptiko, eggze, jprokop users (for desktop env) and only jprokop (for vps env)
	- plus proper sudoers config
		https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/82438/allow-sudo-to-another-user-without-password#82527
	- synaptiko will contain yay cache, config and shared `.files` and other multiuser things
		- refactor yay's installation then
		- I could also run `synaptiko-desktop` under it (if nobody:nobody won't be suitable)

- 0-theme:
  - contact zsh (somehow) and switch pure prompt colors (branch name etc)
  - contact sway and change colors there (+ in bar)

- add support for "git --global config.set" (initialization of git)
- add association for URL/links to open Chromium/Firefox? (over mimeo?)
- add multiuser support/setup
- add "modular" installation; prepare 3 profiles: desktop-sway, "sudo root" user, VPS
- check all fixmes/todos in the files!
- add support for updating plugins (zsh + tmux; or to check if there are new updates)
- add support for installation from my own repositories
- consider forking: http://archibold.io/
- adapt switching color theme to alacritty (should be easy)
- report feature request/issue with yay -Sy && yay -Pn (mention partial upgrades, need for sudo and post my previous version of checkversion.sh script for context)
